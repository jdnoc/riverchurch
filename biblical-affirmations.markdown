## VICTORIOUS LIVING

Thank You Father God, I am the Body Christ, I was crucified with Christ, I died with Christ, I was buried with Christ, I was raised with Christ, I was seated with Christ, therefore I rule and reign with Christ. 

Satan's power over my life is broken, satan's power over my mind is broken, satan's power over my thought life is broken, satan's power over my body is broken, satan's power over my family is broken, satan's power over my money is broken.

From this day to my last day, I walk in total, absolute victory. From this day to my last day, I walk in the finished work of Christ.

* Romans 6:8,

* Colossians 3:1,
* Ephesians 2:6,
* 2 Timothy 2:11,
* Ephesians 1:19-23.

Thank You Father God, Christ has redeemed me from the curse of the law. The curse and its effects have been broken off of my life. I am free from all sickness, disease, plagues, pain, poverty, lack, confusion, stress, failure, infertility, drought, famine, calamity, oppression, depression, bondage, disgrace, loss, or any other effect of the curse. None of these shall be part of or associated with my life. 

Thank You Father God, I am blessed. This means everything that I set my hand to is blessed!  The Lord has opened His good treasure to me. The Lord causes me to be plenteous in goods. My storehouses, which include my bank accounts, are blessed. I lend to many and borrow from none. I am blessed going in and I am blessed going out. I am blessed in the city and in the country. Blessed is the fruit of my body, the produce of my ground and the increase of my herds or my business(es).  Whatever carries my resources is blessed, whatever produces my food is blessed. The Lord has opened the heavens to give me rain in its season. Any enemy that rises against me will easily be defeated. The land that I am living in is blessed. People all around the world will see that I belong to God and that He has blessed me. I am the head and not the tail. I am above only and not beneath. I am blessed!

* Galatians 3:13-14,
* Hebrews 8:6,
* Deuteronomy 28. Blessings v.1-14, curse v.15-68.

Thank You Father God, You always lead me in triumph in Christ. Jesus disarmed the devil and He triumphed over him, therefore I triumph over the devil. I am an overcomer because I have the greater one living in me. I am well able to do anything because Jesus Christ gives me strength. I have the wisdom of God in me. I have the mind of Christ. You always give me the victory through Jesus Christ.

* 1 John 4:4,

Thank You Father God, You have rescued me from the dominion of darkness and translated me into the kingdom of Your own dear Son. I have been redeemed by the blood of Your Son Jesus and my sins are forgiven. My old life is gone, I am a brand new creation. I live in the new man, therefore I live in righteousness and holiness. I am the righteousness of God in Christ. I am dead to sin, I am alive in You, sin has no power in my life. I am free of sin and its effects.

* John 1:12,
* Galatians 3:26,
* Ephesians 2:10.

Thank You Father God, all things are working together for my good because I love You and I am called according to Your purpose. You have blessed me with every spiritual blessing.

## HEALING

Thank You Father God for Your benefits, for healing me from all my diseases, for satisfying me with good things, and renewing my youth. By the stripes of Jesus, I have been healed. You sent Your Word and healed me, and delivered me from all my destructions. Jesus said that healing is the children's bread; and I am Your child, therefore healing belongs to me. Jesus took up my infirmities and carried my diseases. You are the Lord who heals me and You take sickness away from me.

Thank You Father God that Your Word says whatever I bind on earth will be bound in heaven and whatever I loose on earth will be loosed in heaven. Therefore I bind sickness, pain and disease in my body and I loose healing and strength into my body from the top of my head to the soles of my feet. 

* Matthew 16:19,
* Matthew 18:18.

## PROSPERITY

Thank You Father God, as I sow generously into Your kingdom, I am reaping a generous harvest. I always have all sufficiency in all things and have an abundance for every good work. You supply me with seed for sowing and bread for eating, You multiply the seed that I have sown which causes and increased harvest of prosperity.  I am being made rich in every way so that I can be generous on every occasion.

* 2 Corinthians 9:6-11.

Thank You Father God, just as Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph became very rich, very prosperous, exceedingly prosperous and successful by serving You, You are making me very rich, very prosperous, exceedingly prosperous and successful as I serve you.
