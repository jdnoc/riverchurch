# The Kingdom Of Heaven

## The Mission of Jesus

Jesus came to establish the kingdom of God on earth.

In Matthew 3, Jesus was baptized by John in the river Jordan. Jesus didn't start his ministry until he was baptized in the holy spirit. 

Matthew 4:17 - Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.

This was Jesus’ message. He actually never preached anything else. He said a lot of things and did a lot of things, but he only preached the Kingdom of heaven.

Establishing the Kingdom of heaven on earth was the mission of Jesus. The world has never been the same since Jesus’ was alive. 

There is no way if you become a Christian, and you partake in this Kingdom, that your life will stay the same. It will only get better. 

Jesus began to tell people about his citizenship. About the kingdom, he came from.

Matthew 4:23 - Preaching the Good News of the Kingdom. And he healed all.

Jesus went all over preaching and teaching the gospel of the Kingdom.

## The New Kingdom’s Authority

So, what is the good news of the kingdom? People thought that Jesus was going to be a natural king. But Jesus was referring to a different government. 

Isaiah 9:6

The natural leaders of Israel were threatened because they thought he was going to be a natural king, so that’s why they always tried to kill him and shut him down. 

But it didn't work because Jesus was talking about a different kingdom.

Jesus went around healing everyone. How? Because in the kingdom of God, there is no sickness, there is no disease, there is no poverty. 

Jesus came to colonize the world. When a kingdom takes over a country and colonizes it, they old country becomes like the new owner.

When people come from another country, they bring their customs with them. Jesus wasn’t from this kingdom, he was from heaven. He broke all of the rules here and it drove everyone nuts.

Jesus didn’t come to form a religion. The Bible is a contract, a testament, a covenant, a legal document. It’s not about religion.

Jesus came to deal with people’s hearts. All he needs is your heart, and then he has your entire being.

When you are born again, your citizenship is no longer of this world, but of the kingdom of heaven. 

We no longer live under the benefits of this kingdom, but we live under the benefits and contracts of heaven. 

So when you read the bible, it tells you things that are relevant to you because you belong to that kingdom, and your old kingdom’s laws don’t matter (the earth). 

The world is always trying to force its government on your life. But no matter what, it doesn't compare to the laws and citizenships that we have in this book.

When you go to a different country, we have an embassy that will protect you overseas. But, it doesn't compare to the kingdom of heaven, because it is so much more powerful. Everyone that came to Jesus and experienced the kingdom of God, they were healed and saved. 

When Adam sinned, we left the kingdom of God, so God sent Jesus to re-establish us into the kingdom of God. 

Jesus came to colonize earth into the kingdom of God. All he has to do is talk about the kingdom of heaven.

When you join that kingdom, you’ll talk different, you’ll look different, and act differently. 

Jesus, when he did the sermon on the mount, he was talking about the conduct of the kingdom of heaven. He said that all sins begin in the heart. It’s not just the physical actions of sin. 

The world, the religious system of today, focusses on the physical acts of sin. Jesus didn’t care about that. He cared about your heart, and if you have no heart issues, you won’t sin.

This was a totally new way of thinking. It’s not about your actions, but about your heart. When you change your heart, it changes your actions. 

When you grow up, if you have good parents, you know what is right or wrong. But, you can still have heart issues. And those drive your actions, whether you know if they are right or wrong.

You may have gotten yourself in a mess in the world, and you need to amend your past transgressions, but God will work on your behalf to sort it out as long as you are obedient to what God has called you to do.

The beatitudes were talking about the conduct of the kingdom of heaven. As long as you conduct yourself as you are living in the kingdom, you will get the benefits of living in that kingdom.

## The Benefits of the Kingdom Of Heaven

You can’t break the laws of the citizenship you find yourself in and expect to receive the benefits of that kingdom.

Matthew 8:1 - When Jesus came down from the mountainside, large crowds followed him. A man with leprosy\[[a](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%208:1-4#fen-NIV-23348a)\] came and knelt before him and said, “Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.” Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. “I am willing,” he said. “Be clean!” Immediately he was cleansed of his leprosy. Then Jesus said to him, “See that you don’t tell anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.”

Jesus didn’t belong to the Roman government, the Jewish government, he belonged to the kingdom of heaven, and his culture followed him everywhere.

Everything in Jesus’ life was about showing you what the Kingdom of heaven is like.

He can speak to the winds and they obey. He can speak to sickness and it leaves. Jesus was from a different kingdom, the kingdom of heaven. He doesn’t operate under the laws of earth, he operates under the laws of heaven.

Ephesians 2:19 You are fellow citizens of the household of God. 

Philippians 3:20 Our citizenship is in heaven.

If you are saved, you are a citizen of heaven, not of earth. If you let Jesus deal with your heart completely, he will be the ruler and king of your life, and you will receive the benefits of the kingdom.

People will act like they are spiritual, but they don’t actually act like they live in the kingdom of heaven. You will see nothing but benefits. 

Not only are you a citizen of heaven, but you are a son or daughter of God. When a son or daughter of the king comes to town, they are treated differently. They aren’t worried about anything, finances, safety because the kingdom provides that for them. It’s your birthright in the kingdom, to have all of these benefits.

We are sons and daughters of God. Why do we live like we are children of the world? We have the inheritance of heaven. We can live like king’s kids. Which means we don’t have to put up with the world's garbage.

We should have peace that passes all understanding, a happy marriage, everything that our contract (the Bible) says we should have.
