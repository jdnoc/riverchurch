Matt. 7:24-27

The rain falls on the just and the unjust alike. 

Storms will come to everyone. You can determine the outcome of that storm - how you will come out of that storm. 

Storms come when you least expect them. Usually when you start to get some traction, it’s right there to bring you down. Or, you can let it strengthen you. It’s your decision. 

Just because the storm’s intention is to bring you down and destroy you, doesn’t mean that you can’t move forward stronger and better for it.

Storms will test your faith and show you what’s inside of you. When you go through things that are unpleasant, it exposes what’s inside of you. You either need to work on things, or you will be able to go through unscathed.

We need to stay in the fire of God so that we can train ourselves to be strong through the storms. Rather than nasty things being exposed, the fire of God will be exposed, and the storm will be no match.

Be ready for the storm. Jesus isn’t saying that the storms won’t come, but be ready when it comes. How can you be ready? Faith. 

Many christians have little faith. Trailer park faith. When a hurricane comes, their home isn’t ready for the storm. 

They talk about all of the things that are going to happen to them, and talk about how expensive the repairs will be after the storm. 

God is always going to bring increase. When a door closes, a better one opens. Have your faith grounded in God, and you’ll be able to go through anything without being bothered. 

The disciples were in a storm, and Jesus was in the back. These were fishermen, they knew that the storm was serious. They were panicking, but Jesus was sleeping in the back. And that is what our response is to be through the storms. 

We can’t let the storm shake us.

One way to release your faith is through your words. You should be speaking the word of God over your situation. I know that my needs are met according to His riches and glory. This gives God room to move on your behalf.

Are you prepared for the storm? You have to be. The people that get hurt are the people who are trying to prepare for the storm when the storm is coming. 

Don’t wait for a storm to happen to start praying. The best time to start praying was before it happened. 

Jesus said if you’re wise you’ll be prepared. Not just reacting to the storm.

Psalms 34:1-10

As a Christian, you can’t live by feelings. You have feelings, but don’t let them control you. Remain grounded in the word, not grounded in your emotions. 

The word of God is unemotional. It just works. What does God’s word say about your situation?

Romans 8:5-7

Many people struggle with anxiety and their thought life, and that’s being carnally minded. But, to be spiritually minded, is life and peace. 

You will not find it in your head. You’ll find it in your heart - being led by the spirit.

If you’re in a storm and you want to panic, what are you listening to? Are you listening to your mind? This world? Or, are you listening to the spirit of God?

To be spiritually minded is life and peace. 

For as many are led by the spirit of God, these are the sons of God. 

Romans 8:27-28

Don’t let your confession be affected by the storm. Let your confession change the storm.

Prepare for storms, everyone will experience them. You don’t have to be in a panic. You can take the storms head on.
