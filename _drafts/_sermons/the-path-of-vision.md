God has a specific plan for your life. Something that only you can do. You’ll be able to reach people that other people won’t be able to reach.

There are three areas that you can be used in. Government, business, and ministry. That’s a generalization, but most things lead back to those things.

As believers, no matter where you fit in business and government, God will still use you in the ministry and be connected to perform a function of the ministry.

The objective for you is to figure out what your function of the ministry is. God will give you a specific vision for your life, and then the goal is for you to bring impact in that area.

If you don’t have vision, you can’t have impact. Every person in this room should be remembered for the impact they made. No one is called to just run a rat race. God has something much bigger than that for you.

You’re here to day because you know that God will touch you and allow you to impact your generation. If you don’t have that desire, you need vision.

Every destiny emerges on the platform of vision. Life is mere existence until you have vision for your life. Just going through the motions and not making an impact.

The path your vision takes isn’t always straight.

Acts 9 - Where Paul (Saul) has an encounter with  Jesus. God had a specific plan and purpose for Saul’s life. 

Immediately Paul heads towards that vision and starts preaching the Gospel. Acts will make you assume that, but turning to Galatians you’ll figure out how long that journey was.

Galatians 1: 15-20 

For 17 years we don’t know what Paul did, because the Bible doesn’t say. Even though he was called and chosen to go out and do something, it took him 17 years to start fulfilling that calling.

If your goal doesn’t happen tomorrow, don’t get discouraged. The difference between ambition and vision, is that ambition comes from you, but vision comes from God. 

Vision is what God has called you to do, and ambition is a drive. You don’t have to worry about how you will accomplish the vision. Since it’s from God, you can trust that he’s going to foot the bill for whatever you want to accomplish.

Philippians 3 - Paul presses on towards the high call that God has on his life. 

Find people that you can link up with that can help you accomplish your vision. Of your friends, and the people around you, are they asking you questions? You’ll never grow keeping them around. 

Who do you have that you can ask questions? Find people that you can get value from so you can grow into the vision you have been called to.

Genesis 12:1-4

75 years had gone by before Abraham received vision from the Lord.

Genesis 21:5

For another 25 years he still wasn’t blessed according to what God had called him to do. Ambition created Ishmael, vision created Issac.

1 Samuel 16:13

25 years after being anointed to be king, he finally became the king.

The vision comes from the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. God will give you visions and purpose. 

Proverbs 29 “Where there is no vision the people perish”.

Paul, Abraham and David were working towards their goal. 

When you have vision, nothing can stop you. Take a step of faith today. Make it a part of your life and work towards the goal. Get clarity of vision from God.

Ask God, “What is it you have called me to do?”
