If you are a Christian then you should desire to help other people. (If you're a "Christian" that doesn't want to help other people- then you need to get saved)  Jesus said in Matthew 25 when you feed the hungry, give drink to the thirsty, clothe the naked, it is as if you were doing those things to Him. Clearly those are things that believers should be doing.  Also Jesus said that it is more blessed to give than it is to receive.  So the question I want to ask here is how can you do any of those things if you are broke and have nothing to give.  If you are broke, you are going to focused on feeding yourself, not feeding other people.

"It is more blessed to give than to receive"… why? Yes there is the fact that it does feel really great to do something selfless and nice to somebody else. There is more to the blessing than that… Jesus also said "Give, and it will be given to you: good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over will be put into your bosom. For with the same measure that you use, it will be measured back to you." So not only is the blessing to your emotions that make you feel good about helping somebody else, but also you can expect to receive a financial blessing back!

The Church- which is made up of believers in Jesus- needs to get rid of a small minded poverty thinking.  Many people will disagree with this statement: I think you should make as much money as you possibly can. I think you should make so much money that your biggest problem is figuring out what to do with all of it.  I'm sure some people reading that think "How can he say something like that?".  Imagine what good you would be able to accomplish if you had millions of dollars. Imagine how many people you could feed, how many ministries you could finance.

This is how imagine the faces of religious people as they read this. Please take a moment to look into a mirror right now and examine your face, if it looks anything like this lady, then you probably should just stop reading.

So are these things that I am saying totally off the wall? Should believers be making millions of dollars? Most Christians have become content with providing just enough money for their own family and being able to give a little bit that was left over to the church. At the same time they are content seeing secular companies make millions and billions of dollars, which allows them to have a huge influence over entire areas of society.

I recently read a couple news articles about the company Target  (which according to Forbes is worth somewhere around $53 billion dollars. That looks like this: $53,000,000,000) The news articles were about Target introducing "gender neutral" bathrooms in its stores. I hope that you find this as outrageous as I do.  Of course there are Christians posting on social media that they are going to boycott Target, but do you really think that is going to affect a company worth $53 billion?

The problem is that as long as secular businesses/institutions are making vast amounts of wealth, and Christians think that having vast amounts of wealth is wrong- it is going to be secular companies that are going to have major impact on society, and not Christians.

Should I be rich?

Psalm 112 is and incredible chapter, here are a few verses from it: Blessed is the man who fears the Lord, Who delights greatly in His commandments. His descendants will be mighty on earth; The generation of the upright will be blessed. Wealth and riches will be in his house, And his righteousness endures forever.

Most people believe that God provides us with spiritual freedom when we become Christians.  But what about financial freedom? It is hard to misinterpret "Wealth and riches will be in his house"… If you look that up in the original language it says: "Wealth and riches will be in his house". Amazing.

In the end of Psalm 112 it says: He has dispersed abroad, He has given to the poor; His righteousness endures forever; His horn will be exalted with honor. The wicked will see it and be grieved; He will gnash his teeth and melt away; The desire of the wicked shall perish.

The devil doesn't want you to be wealthy.  He hates seeing Christians prosper.  This scripture says that wicked people will see it and be grieved, they will gnash their teeth in anger.  The devil is wicked through and through- and he doesn't want to see any Christian pulling ahead or getting wealthy.  Therefore he has convinced most Christians that it is good to be poor.

Deuteronomy 8:18 says that God gives us the power to get wealth.  Why would God give us the power to get something if He didn't want us to get it?  God does want you to be blessed. He wants you to be so blessed that the greatness of the blessing on your life overflows onto all those who are around you.

> Is having a huge bank account the only way to make change in this world?  Absolutely not.  However it does make it a lot easier.  When you have a bank balance that allows you to do whatever you want, you can get creative with thinking up new ways on how to bless people.  Imagine if you had billions of dollars what you could to with it… You could feed entire nations of starving people, and then be able to share the gospel with them.  If you are anything like me- when somebody offers to take me out to a nice dinner (at their expense) to talk to me about something, I am much more likely to want to go and listen to them.  So what if you bought dinner for millions of people? Lets start thinking big, lets not be content with just providing for ourselves and our own families. We should have enough wealth to provide for the nations!
