The Bible is full of life giving treasure. Like any treasure- some can be found on or near the surface, but most of it you have to dig and search for. The Bible is no different, and with some teaching and practice- you too can begin to discover spiritual treasure in the Word of God. That’s what this series of lessons is all about; helping you look at the Bible from a new light and grow spiritually by feeding on God’s word.

## Information and Tips about the Bible.

The Bible was written by about 42 authors over a period of time of about 1600 years. There is no other book like this that doesn’t contradict itself, and that has the same underlying message throughout the whole book. This is because though this book was written by human hands, it is not an ordinary book, it is the written word of God that was inspired by the Holy Spirit.

However, because of the fact that it was written over such a long period of time, it is important to understand the context of what was taking place. By understanding the context (historical, cultural, social, etc.) you can gain a better understand of the true purpose for God’s instruction to us. You will also be able to better apply the Word to your own personal life- and that’s what this is all about.

**TIP**: Interpret the Bible by the Bible. The Bible instructs multiple times: in the mouths of 2 or 3 witnesses let every word be established. Doctrine is the same! Don’t create major doctrine over one verse- any major doctrine in God’s Word must be backed up by multiple scriptures.

## Understanding Language and Translation is Important

**Example**: The Hebrew language doesn’t use capitalization or punctuation. This is a huge deal! Why? Example within the example: Sometimes the word “spirit” in the Bible has a capital “S” and sometimes a lowercase “s”, which have two totally different implications. Spirit (capital S) implies “Holy Spirit” whereas spirit (little s) can imply many things (human spirit, angelic spirit, demonic spirit, etc.)

So, just the capitalization of one letter could drastically change the meaning of a scripture (Hopefully the translators got it right!).

**Another example**: The first English translation is the Wycliffe bible written by John Wycliffe in the 1300’s but it was translated from the Latin Vulgate (published in 382 AD). No big deal right? Wrong- the original texts were written in Greek, Hebrew, and Aramaic. This is important because the Wycliffe bible would be a translation of a translation- and the more translations you have the more chance for error…

Like the “telephone game” where somebody starts a message and by word of mouth passes it from one person to the next until the last person shares the message and it is generally very different from the original message.

**Solution**: Learn to speak ancient Greek, Hebrew, and Aramaic. Just kidding.

What if a particular person or group that translated the bible had biases about that they believe when they translated the Bible? If a translator didn’t believe that it was God’s will for everybody to be healed- could that change the way the Bible was translated? Did you know that certain translations leave out scriptures from the Bible?

Take the NIV for example (sorry if this is your favorite translation). They leave out 16 verses that are in the KJV. *They are listed at the bottom if you are curious*.

You might be wondering “So how does this help me?”... You just need to be aware that just because one version of the Bible says something a certain way- doesn’t mean that it is necessarily the only way of interpreting it. Becoming a student of God’s Word will help you know what the original purpose and message that was written.

I’m not telling you that you shouldn’t read the NIV. The NLT is one of the versions that I like to read and it is also missing quite a few scriptures! I didn’t throw away my NLT- I just keep another version with me (like a KJV) when I’m reading- to compare it to.

## Conclusion

The important thing to know is that though the original text was inspired by the Holy Spirit, man has done his best job to translate the Word of God into other languages while preserving the integrity of it. Because of this human element- we must use wisdom when reading the Bible (unless you get the original texts and can understand those languages).

Become a student of God’s Word. Read from a few different translations and compare them to each other. Do some research about who wrote the version of the Bible you enjoy reading from. Above all: ask God for wisdom- because He promises to give it to you when you ask Him with faith! Remember- if you have the Holy Spirit on the inside of you- then He will lead you and guide you into all truth.
