God wants you to be wealthy, if you disagree with that- I'm not going to argue with you, I will be content to watch you stay poor. At this point in the email (second sentence), I have probably lost some readers but that's fine. It is interesting to think that somebody would argue the fact that God wants you to be wealthy… Any rational minded person would get excited and want to find out more about that.  Maybe sinners would be more interested in hearing about a God that wants you to be blessed, than a God that wants you to stay poor and "humble".  (Humility has nothing to do with your financial status)

If you was a sinner, and a Christian that's driving a piece of junk stops to tell you about the blessing of being a child of God- you would probably think that person is kind of squirrely (Or at least you should think that) On the other hand if a Christian drives up in a brand new car with nice new clothes (everything paid for with cash), and they tell somebody about the blessing of the Lord… To me it seems like that person would have a little more credibility.

Maybe you are a Christian that's driving a piece of junk right now. Don't get mad at me, just lift up your eyes and realize that there is better out there for you. God wants you to partake of the best of the land!

Today I want to focus on the practical side of making money.

## Spiritual Ghost Busters

When Christians are not prospering it is very common for them to only focus on the spiritual side of things.  Rather than looking at income and expenditures, profits and losses, and many other practical sides to obtaining wealth- they focus totally on the spiritual side of things.

Chances are, most Christians would blame the devil for attacking their finances when in reality it is a problem that they created for themselves.  I'm not saying that there aren't times that you need to pray about your financial situation and find out what is going on. But many times Christians seek a spiritual reason for a natural problem.

For example: If you spend more money than you earn, you will be in debt. The bible says that the borrower is servant to the lender.  This isn't a spiritual principle, this is a natural fact that when you owe people money, you become their servant financially.  The devil did not force you to go to TJ Maxx and Max our your credit cards- you did that, and now you will pay the consequences for that. Stop trying to cast devils out of problems that you created.

## Laziness

When I was in Bible school I knew many people that were "living by faith". If they weren't saved and didn't speak Christianese, they would say they were "unemployed". Living by faith doesn't mean sitting around playing video games and believing that all of your needs will be met.

My first job I had while I was in Bible school was a sales job, in one week of work I made over $1,000. How many of those dollars would I have earned if I had decided to stay home that week and play pokemon? Going to work gives God an opportunity to bless the work of your hands.

Be productive.  If you are employed, decide that you are going to be the best employee at your company.  Show up early, work late, do whatever it takes to be the best.  You should work for your company as if you were working for Jesus himself.

"Why should I work hard for a secular company?" Because God promotes people that are faithful with what they have now.  If you have a job now, and are faithful there- God will make you ruler over much. Maybe while you're working there, God will give you a brilliant idea and you use that to start your own company!

> Proverbs 10:4 He who has a slack hand becomes poor,But the hand of the diligent makes rich.

## Save Money

A great man of God said that while he was talking to the Lord about why he didn't have any money the Lord spoke to him and said "You don't have any money because you don't save any money."  Saving money is a principle that is found in the Bible:

Proverbs 21:20 (AMP) There is precious treasure and oil in the house of the wise [who prepare for the future], But a short-sighted and foolish man swallows it up and wastes it.

A fool uses up and wastes all his money.  A wise man has precious treasure stored up in his house.  Some people feel like saving money isn't necessary because God will always take care of their needs.

Yes God will provide all of your needs (as long as you meet the conditions) but don't you desire to be at the place where you are not focused on having your needs met? Wouldn't it be better to focus on meeting other peoples needs?

We should have an abundance of financial provision. We should be so blessed that when needs arise- God uses us to provide for others.  One way to do that is by having money saved and set aside for such times.
