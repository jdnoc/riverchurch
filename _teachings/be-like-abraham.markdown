> **Deuteronomy 28:12** - "… You shall lend to many nations, but you shall not borrow."

Was God joking when he wrote that? Or does he want you to be THAT blessed? The blessing of God made Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob rich. How then do we come into this Godly prosperity where we are rich like they were?

If you want to get what they got, then you have to do what they did… That should make you wonder: what did they do?

Here are 3 keys to the blessing from the life of Abraham.

## #1 Immediate obedience to the Word of God is what brings success and prosperity

> **Genesis 12:1** - "Now the Lord had said to Abram: Get out of your country, From your family And from your father’s house, To a land that I will show you… 4 So Abram departed as the Lord had spoken to him, and Lot went with him. And Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran."

After God finished speaking to Abraham about what he was to do, it doesn’t say that Abraham prayed about what to do, it doesn’t say that Abraham sought counsel with the elders.

Abraham IMMEDIATELY obeyed the word of God. He left his father’s house and all that he knew behind. You have to be willing to do whatever God says do.

## #2 Be willing to do whatever it takes to have the blessing of God on your life

In Genesis 17 God again speaks to Abraham about the His covenant with him. This time God tells Abraham that the sign of the covenant between them is the circumcision. Look what Abraham’s response was…

Verse 23 So Abraham took Ishmael his son, all who were born in his house and all who were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham’s house, and circumcised the flesh of their foreskins that very same day, as God had said to him. 24 Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.

Abraham obeyed immediately! I don’t know about you, but if I was 99 years old and the Lord told me that I needed to be circumcised- along with every male in my house, I would assume that I had eaten some bad brownies and that the whole thing was a hallucination. It’s not like Abraham could take the men of his house to the nearest hospital, pass out from some anesthetics and then take some pain relievers after losing part of their manliness. Not only did Abraham obey that very day, but so did every male in his house. Let me tell you, if I was one of the men in Abraham's house, I would have gone AWOL the moment I heard about the operation.

Abraham knew that the most important thing in life was having God’s blessing, and he was willing to do whatever it took in order for he and his house to be blessed.

## #3 Give God whatever He asks for

For years Abraham had been waiting for the promise to come to pass that was spoken to him by God in Genesis 12… That through Abraham all the nations of the Earth will be blessed, and that the land which he was in would be given to his descendants. Abraham was 99 years old and still did not have the child that was to fulfill the promises God had given him.

Abraham waited 25 years for his son from the time that he received the promise to the time that the child was born. And then this happens…

> **Genesis 22:1** - "Now it came to pass after these things that God tested Abraham, and said to him, “Abraham!” And he said, “Here I am.” 2 Then He said, “Take now your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I shall tell you.” 3 So Abraham rose early in the morning and saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son."

God spoke to Abraham to offer his son Isaac as a sacrifice, after all these years of waiting for him.  Abraham did not hesitate to obey.  It says that Abraham rose early in the morning, to take Isaac

Abraham was willing to offer his most precious possession to God. At the last moment God stopped Abraham from sacrificing his child- and then provided a ram for the sacrifice. Abraham had proved to God that he would give anything to Him that He asked of him.
