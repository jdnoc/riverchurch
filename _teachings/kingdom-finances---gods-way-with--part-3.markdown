If you have read the last few emails I have sent regarding finances you know that I believe according to the scripture that God wants to be wealthy. Not only is the Bible full of passages that declare God's desire for us to prosper but also how we can achieve that prosperity.  One thing that seems to have stopped many modern Christians from coming into wealth (or even the desire to have wealth) is the idea that you have to choose between God and money.

The Bible does say that nobody can serve God and mammon. What is mammon? Mammon does not just mean money, it means the love of money, it means lusting after wealth, it means that money has your heart and God does not. Does this mean that you if you desire to be wealthy that you have an evil desire? This is can only be answered by examining your heart and your motives.

The Bible also say that the love of money is the root of all evil, it isn't the money that is evil.  What can be evil is to motive for wanting money, but not the money itself. The title of this email is "Kingdom Finances"… This implies that you are in the Kingdom of God- that you are a Christian. If you are a Christian, and are led by the Spirit of God, then chances are you aren't thinking of evil schemes for you to use your money to go against God's purposes.

So maybe before you read any further you should take a moment to examine your heart in regards to finances. Think about these questions while you are searching your heart… Do I want to buy or sell illegal drugs with my money? Do I want to buy a militia and pillage villages of innocent people? Do I want to fund organizations that kill human babies before they are born?

I really hope that while contemplating those questions, you didn't answer yes to any of them.  If you did answer yes (or if you look like the guy in this photo) then respond to this email and I will tell you how you can get saved.

The reason I asked those ridiculous questions is because so many Christians make it sound like once you obtain wealth, you will stray from God and spend your money on evil things. If you are a real Christian, then you would use wealth for good things if you had it. Like funding ministries that preach the gospel, funding Christian organizations that feed starving people, build orphanages, provide education, etc.  I believe that if God really has your heart, you will use wealth to do good, to spread the gospel and take care of people.

Seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you. As Christians we first seek God's kingdom and His righteousness, this comes before seeking wealth or any other thing.  If you are seeking God's kingdom first, then "all these things shall be added to you", all of your needs will be met. You will not lack any good thing.

If you are not seeking God's kingdom first then you should not be seeking after wealth.  Seeking God is always first, and must always remain so.  Establishing God's kingdom here on earth, bringing heaven to people here is our objective.  Why else would Jesus teach us to pray "Your kingdom come Your will be done On earth as it is in heaven." ?

What do you think Heaven is like? Is heaven full of poverty? Is the bank in heaven running out of gold? Part of bringing heaven to earth is done by meeting peoples needs, and that won't be done without provision.

This is a direct quote written in response to last weeks email on finances: "On wealth, I believe God would have His church to be blessed on two conditions. I would argue that God first wants your heart as opposed to wealth. Second, I believe wealth is a product of wisdom, knowledge and understanding"… To the author: I would like to thank you for bestowing your kind words of wisdom upon me.

This is such a typical response to any Christian that talks about prosperity. It is OBVIOUS that God first wants your heart, just take a look at the ten commandments.  If anybody that has read these emails thinks that I am implying that God should bless you without Him having your heart: you need reading lessons.

Wealth is not the covenant. Wealth is just one of the benefits that come with the covenant.  Having a covenant relationship with God has blessings and benefits.

> Deuteronomy 28:2 And all these blessings shall come upon you and overtake you, because you obey the voice of the Lord your God

> Psalm 103:2 Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits

I didn't enter into a relationship with my wife to have sex, but it is one of the benefits (which is nice). I didn't enter into a relationship with God in order to get wealthy, but wealth is one of the benefits of the relationship.

A marriage that is built on a physical relationship will fail.  A relationship with God that is built on a desire for wealth will fail. You have to enter into a relationship with a pure motive, to spend time with and truly love with all of who you are in order for it to be a success, both with God and man.
