Chances are that you have idea's about Christianity and money. Where did you get those ideas? Did you get them from the Word of God or from man? Your theology must be based on the Word of God, not on the word of man.

## Who is God?

> **Acts 3:13** - The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our fathers, glorified His Servant Jesus.

If Peter called Him the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob then those men are probably worth reading about. How did they live? Poverty or Prosperity?

Abraham:

> **Genesis 13:2** - Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold

Isaac:

> **Genesis 26:13** - The man began to prosper, and continued prospering until he became very prosperous

Jacob:

> **Genesis 30:43** - Thus the man became exceedingly prosperous, and had large flocks, female and male servants, and camels and donkeys.

What do these scriptures have to do with you?

You:

> **Galatians 3:26** - For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus. 27 For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. 28 There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus. 29 And if you are Christ’s, then you are Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise.

Wow, isn't that awesome?!?! In case you aren't very intelligent, let me explain what that means… If you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise!!! (See what I did there?)

## God’s word to Abram (Abraham)

> **Genesis 12:1** - Now the Lord had said to Abram: “Get out of your country, From your family And from your father’s house, To a land that I will show you. 2 I will make you a great nation; I will bless you And make your name great; And you shall be a blessing. 3 I will bless those who bless you, And I will curse him who curses you; And in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed.”

> **Genesis 17:7** - And I will establish My covenant between Me and you and your descendants after you in their generations, for an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and your descendants after you.

When somebody makes a promise to you today, you might think to yourself that there is a slim chance of it coming to pass. This is not so with God and His Word- when He says something, He means it. He says that his covenant is an **everlasting covenant**. God's covenant doesn't go away!!

That means that the covenant of Abraham still exists today with you and me.

The covenant that God made with Abraham is not prosperity itself. However, the fruit of the covenant is prosperity. You are meant to live in prosperity, not in poverty.

I hope you understand that prosperity belongs to you! God wants YOU to PROSPER. Not just spiritually, but materially as well. (Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold)… Have you ever seen a spiritual cow, or piece of silver or gold? If you have, then you have problems. Livestock, silver, and gold are material possessions.

The Promise is what caused Abraham, Isaac and Jacob to become rich! You are an heir according to that promise!
