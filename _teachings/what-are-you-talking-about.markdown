Confession is not just telling a priest what sins you have committed. What comes out of your mouth impacts your life more than we sometimes imagine. 

Proverbs 18:19 says that death **and** life are in the power of the tongue.  This means that you can speak death to your life, or that you can speak life to your life. 

It takes concentrated effort to monitor and edit what is coming out of your mouth, but the fruit of doing so is truly rewarding.  The life you are experiencing now is largely the result of your words that you have spoken. If the words that we speak are so important, then what should we speak? The best words to speak (confessions to make) are those that are based on Gods Word.

We could spend a lot of time discussing many scriptures that give us positive faith filled confessions, but today I want to focus on one type. Have you noticed that many times in the bible when people prayed to God they started with giving honor to Him? I think that is a great place to start making positive confessions. 

When you spend time praising and honoring God it is very difficult to stay sad or defeated. I have listed a few bible based confessions below that honor God.

> **Psalm 34:3** - "Oh, magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt His name together."

Make an effort to make the following confessions a part of your life and I guarantee you see will begin to see your words produce a wonderful results in your present and future!

> **Exodus 15:2** - "God, you are my strength and my defense, you have become my salvation, you are my God and I will praise you, I exalt your name."

> **Psalm 7:17** - "I give thanks to you Lord because of your righteousness, and I will sing praise to your name, Lord Most High."

> **Ephesians 1:3** - "Praise be to the God and Father of our LORD Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in the heavenly realms with every spiritual blessing in Christ."

> **Psalm 9:1-2** - "I will praise you, O LORD, with all my heart; I will tell of all your wonders. I will be glad and rejoice in you; I will sing praise to your name, O Most High."
> 
**Psalm 86:12** - "I praise You, O Lord my God, with all my heart, And I glorify Your name forevermore."

> **Revelation 1:8** - "You are Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty."

> **Isaiah 43:15** - "You are my Lord, the Holy One, the creator of Israel, my King." 

> **Psalm 104:1** - "Praise the LORD, O my soul. O LORD, my God, you are very great; you are clothed with splendor and majesty."
