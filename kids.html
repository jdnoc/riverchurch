            <p>River Kids is designed with you and your children in mind. We want to partner with you as you lead your children in a growing relationship with Jesus. We strive to create a safe and fun environment for your children to learn and grow in the things of God. We will teach your children the Word of God, and that the Word of God is the truth and it is for them now. We understand that we are helping raise up the next generation. We also understand that they don’t need to wait until they are older to have a relationship with Jesus and to make an impact on this World. Children are a blessing from the Lord, each one with a purpose, we consider it an honor to partner with you to see your children grow.</p>
            <h2 class="text-center">Safety</h2>
            <p>
            To provide the most rewarding and safest experience for your children all of our volunteers have been screened, trained, and have had a federal background check.

            <h2 class="text-center">Parent Connect</h2>
            <p>
            You as the parent have a HUGE role in your children’s lives. Parent connect is the place you can come to see what your children are learning each week in River Kids. This gives you a great opportunity to open discussion with your children, reiterate the lesson at home, or answer any further questions they may have. This is also the place you can contact us with any question you may have.
