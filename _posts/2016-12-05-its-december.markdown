Can you believe that it is already December and Christmas is just around the corner? Christmas is one of my favorite times of year. I love coming together with family and friends with the purpose of celebrating Jesus. (Christmas parties, FOOD, presents and all that are great as well).

Christmas is one of the best times to invite family and friends to church for them to hear the gospel of Jesus Christ. This year we will be having a Christmas Eve service at 6pm, and our Sunday morning service falls on Christmas day this year so that gives us an extra opportunity to celebrate Jesus.

What better way to celebrate Christmas than coming together with those closest to us to worship Jesus Christ as King of kings and Lord of lords? We look forward to seeing you there!
