            <p>People are searching for truth. At our church we believe what Jesus said: <em>â€œI am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me."</em>
            </p>
            <p class="my-3 p-3 border border-dark shadow">Jesus didn't sugarcoat the truth and neither do we. We preach the gospel message of Jesus Christ which gives you an opportunity to make a real and lasting change in your life.
            </p>
            <p>God has called you to live a life of <strong>victory</strong>. Let us help you triumph in life by teaching you the Word of God and creating an environment for you to encounter His presence.

            <p>In 2014 Pastors Jeremiah & Julia started River Church in Brockport NY with a desire impact the surrounding region.
            </p>
            <p> At church we focus on preaching from the Bible and allowing the Holy Spirit to minister to people.
            </p>
            <p>We emphasize taking the good news of Jesus outside the walls of the church and teach people how to do this in an effective way.

            <h2>How long is a River Church service?</h2>
            <p>Most Sunday morning services at River Church are about 90 minutes long.</p>
            <h2>What's the service flow?</h2>
            <p>Services begin with the worship team leading the church in song - lyrics are projected onto the screen so you can sing along and worship with us. After this, one of our pastors will teach from the Bible and may pray for people at the leading of the Holy Spirit.</p><p>We encourage people to respond to the message by giving their life to Christ and take action on the word that was shared. We give everybody an opportunity to contribute to the ministry.</p>
            <h2>What's the culture like at River Church?</h2>
            <p> We believe church is meant to be fun, exciting and impacting. Come as you are and expect to feel welcomed as our guest.</p>
            <h2>What about my kids?</h2>
            <p> Children are the future, therefore we make them a priority. We strive to create a safe and fun environment for your children to learn and grow in the things of God. Childcare is offered during our services for children ages 1-12.</p>
