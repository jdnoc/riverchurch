Matthew 7:24-29

Fear is an effect of storms in life. 

When a situation in life happens, fear is usually the first tactic of the devil to get you to confess negativity about your situation.

Fear is the plan of the enemy for you to be devastated by that storm. If you have a fire, you immediately might think about how you’re going to pay your bills, or take care of your family.

For most people, the first thing that will trigger in a storm is fear. They don’t react saying they are blessed, full of joy, and a child of God. They react in fear, and that takes you out of faith and out of God’s word. 

Matthew 8:23

Jesus says something strange here. The disciples were professional sailors. They knew this was a terrible storm. Jesus says, “Why are you so fearful?” To most people, it would be obvious. 

Jesus, don’t you know why I’m fearful? Don’t I have a right to be fearful? 

Have you ever gone through something and you thought you were all alone? That’s how the disciples may have felt. 

People come to Jesus talking about how scared they are and how fearful they are. Jesus isn’t too impressed by that. Getting things off of your chest is not the solution to your problem. 

The reason why Jesus asked that, is because their fear was not valid. God doesn’t consider your fear as valid.

A lot of people think that fear is a mature thing. Parents often worry about their kids. You should parent your kids, but there’s no need to worry. Sickness cannot touch your household because you are children of God.

The normal thing to do is be fearful. But we as christians need to change our attitude. God has not given us a spirit of fear. Why would we ever embrace fear? You cannot let fear operate in your life and expect to anything big for God.

As long as you remain in fear you’re not in faith. The two things contradict each other.

Why was Jesus not fearful during this storm? Fear cannot penetrate perfect love. 

1 John 4:18 - “Perfect love casts out all fear.”

God is love. In God, there can be no fear. To get rid of fear in your life, you need to allow more of God’s love inside of you. When you take on his character, fear has to leave. Because in love there is no fear. God operates in faith, not fear.

Jesus’ faith was stronger than fear. When a situation arose that would have stirred fear, it couldn’t touch Jesus. 

Your faith has to become so strong that fear cannot touch you. You need to be able to say, “ What are you even scared for?”

Faith comes from the word of God, but it also comes from knowing your vision and your purpose. Jesus knew his vision and purpose because he knew he had to go to the cross. He knew that, so he knew that this storm

It’s not that fear isn’t existent, it’s that you cannot react to that fear. The disciples were acting in fear. It’s impossible to please God without faith. 

Jesus didn’t care what they were saying because they were acting in fear. So when you find out bad news, fear will come and it will be a temptation, you don’t have to acknowledge the situation.

The more you trust God, you can laugh in the face of famine and destruction. You have to come to the place of knowing who you are in Christ, and knowing that nothing can touch you, and then fear cannot enter you.

Then, you don’t respond in fear, you speak to the problem and you tell it to go away. And it has to go away in Jesus’ name. 

You always have to speak faith because you know who you are.

It’s not impossible to obtain, it doesn’t take years. It’s a choice. You decide to live that way and walk in faith.

The reason people don’t start businesses, switch jobs, create products, is because of fear. They’re afraid of fear and change. You have to take that first step walking in faith.

Acts 27:21 

“After they had gone a long time without food, Paul stood up before them and said: “Men, you should have taken my advice not to sail from Crete; then you would have spared yourselves this damage and loss. But now I urge you to keep up your courage, because not one of you will be lost; only the ship will be destroyed. Last night an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I serve stood beside me and said, ‘Do not be afraid, Paul. You must stand trial before Caesar; and God has graciously given you the lives of all who sail with you.’ So keep up your courage, men, for I have faith in God that it will happen just as he told me.”

Paul knew that nothing would happen,  because he knew his purpose.

When bad things happen, people question the principles that they’ve established in the word of God. People look at their situation, and they question if God was wrong, or they were wrong about their purpose.

The enemy wants you to question God. That’s the first way he made man fall.

The Lord just closed that door. Nonsense! When you know your purpose, it’s part of God’s plan.

No matter what bad situation comes your way, you know that it can’t touch you. The reason good christians are affected because they aren’t certain. They don’t really believe. They allow thoughts of the enemy to flood their mind and they lose faith.

You need to be able to shake off the snake into the fire and carry on.

Even though it looked like Paul’s path to Rome was a shipwreck (it was), he didn’t give up. Every situation turned out to be a victory for him. He was ridiculously blessed, and had massive revival.

You cannot live in fear. You can’t react in fear. You can’t speak fear. Say I know God is turning this around for me!

Other people suffer defeat in their lives, but I can’t!

Fear will try to come. Every time. It will try to breach your faith. But you can’t let it.

If God has called you to do it, then God is going to provide for you to do it. Things will not go the way you planned. You take the obstacle head on, and you faith becomes stronger, and then the next obstacle you can just laugh. 

If you have fear, you have to do everything you can do to get rid of it.
