John 16

Jesus is saying that it’s to their advantage that the Holy Spirit comes, so that they can be filled and changed.

Acts 1:12-14

The Holy Spirit came and filled all of the people in the upper room, including Mary (which means she’s a pentecostal). 

They were praying in the upper, in one accord, waiting for the Holy Spirit. That was their one purpose.

They weren’t there to hear a band, they weren’t there to dig a well, they were there to seek the Holy Spirit so they could be a witness for the Kingdom.

When you get filled with the Holy Ghost, you’ll get vision. The ultimate goal of every Christian is to be a witness. 

Acts 19:1

Acts 8:14
