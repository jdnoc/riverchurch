> The plans of the diligent lead to profit as surely as haste leads to poverty. - Proverbs 21:5.

Prosperity in life demands the establishment of success, habits, and patterns. 

If you were to receive a large inheritance right now, and you don’t have successful patterns, you’ll lose it all. Look at several retired NFL players.

We need to show God that we can handle prosperity. If God were to bless you today, would you be a good steward of it?

If your out-go is more than your in-go, then you’re not showing God that you’re good at handling money. 

## Do you pass the money test?

People try to use the word and faith to go around the principles of God that lead to prosperity. They use giving, faith, and positive confession to avoid the practical side of things. 

If achieving prosperity were like baking a cake, tithes and offerings would be like flour and eggs. These are essential ingredients. But that would taste awful, and to make it taste better you have to add all of the ingredients that make it taste good.

No matter how big the cake is, the ratio of the ingredients is the same. Only the amount of ingredients changes.

In baking, it’s best, when making a new recipe, to make one and test it to see if you like how it tastes. 

You want to master the recipe on a little cake, and then you can change the proportions of the recipe to make more cakes. 

There’s a lot of ingredients in financial prosperity, there are the essential ingredients, but there are other parts that make it whole.

God say’s he’ll give you bread for eating and bread for sowing. So, if you sow everything, then that’s not biblical.

Giving everything at once is like baking a cake with a new recipe and making lots of them before testing it out. More often than not, it’s not going to turn out good, and you’ll have made a lot.

I’ve been young, and I have been old, and I’ve never seen the righteous forsaken or without bread. 

## You need to eliminate debt 

Debt causes stress. Debt pulls you back. It consumes your mind. When you have bills to pay, and you have no money to pay them, that causes a lot of stress.

You choose to get in debt. People get into a lot of debt, and then they blame the devil for attacking their finances. It’s not true - you chose to get into trouble. 

Debt increases the difficulty of focusing on God. 

If you can get out of debt, you are showing God that you can handle the finances He will give you. 

Most Christians don’t believe that God wants to bless you financially. It’s crazy, but it’s true. But we have to do our part to position ourselves to receive that blessing. 

> The rich rule over the poor, and the borrower is servant to the lender. - Proverbs 22:7

Kenneth Hagin would say, debt isn’t sin, borrowing isn’t sin, borrowing too much is a sin. When you borrow too much, it’s a sin because you’re lying. 

There’s nothing spiritual about budgeting. 

Debt won’t keep you from heaven, but it might get you there quicker ;)

## You need to budget

Typically, one side of the marriage is the nerd, and the other side is the spender. You need to be a team. Most of the time, when there are issues, it’s because you’re not communicating. Lots of communication is necessary.

The plans of the diligent leads to plenty.

You have to plan, not react. When you react with your finances, you will lose it all.

If you don’t know where you money is going, you should write down every transaction for a month. You’ll be shocked where it’s all going. 

With little income, and a practical plan, you can do a lot. God gave you a brain so that you can use it for your benefit. If you’re spending more than you make, how can that lead to prosperity? Stupidity is not the same thing as faith.

## Saving And Investing

Saving and investing is the opposite of debt. If you’re in debt, time works against you. If you invest, time is your friend.

> Dishonest money dwindles away, but whoever gathers money little by little makes it grow. - Proverbs 13:11

Numbers can work in your favor. Here’s how it works: 

An investment of $1000. $100 investment every month. Every year you increase it by 10%. In 40 years, you would have $2.3 million. 50 years would be $7.6 million.

20% you would have $18 million in 40 years. 

You might be a little more seasoned, and you don’t have time on your side, do it for your grand kids. Don’t think you are so far behind. If you can get $1000 in the bank for your grand kids, that will be a lot of money when they get older. 

Parable of the virgins and the oil. The smart ones planned. 

I don’t want to get to the end of my life and run out of financial oil. You can plan to be financially successful. Investing doesn’t have to be tough. 

## Invest In Yourself

Most people don’t set goals for themselves. It sets a destination, and a plan for every day, month, and year. If you have a goal, then you can put all of your effort towards that thing. 

If you don’t have a definite purpose in life, get in the presence of God. You’ll figure it out. When you know your purpose and you have goals, no one can stop you and God will help you achieve them.

Where you put your resources, your energy, and time, it will grow. If you want to increase in business, what are you doing to learn about that? Whatever your plan is. You need to learn how you’re going to do it. 

Our schools don’t teach you about money. They teach you how to get a job, but not how to build wealth.

## Your Prosperity Confession

Your confession doesn’t reflect what you have now. 

**I am not poor. I am a child of God, and I am prospering.** You confession should be where you are going. This is where you’re heading. You can use your tongue to direct your steps. 

If you say "I’m poor, we’ll never have enough…" You’re using your words to destroy your life. 

If people think you’re crazy, let them think you’re crazy. 

## Guard your marriage

What does this have to do with prosperity? Get divorced, and you’ll find out. 

Do whatever you can to protect your marriage. What you invest in your marriage will last all of your life, and your spouse goes to heaven with you. Your money doesn’t.

If you don’t nurture that relationship, and stress causes you to take your focus off of God. Get financially prosperous and you can focus more on investing in your relationships. 

Ares you building your spouse up? Or are you tearing them down? How do you talk about them with your friends? If you build them up, you can build yourself up as well. 

## Parent Your Children

This is a job, and an important job. 

> Start children off on the way they should go, and even when they are old they will not turn from it. - Proverbs 22:6

How do they impact your prosperity? If you parent them well, they won’t need you to bail them out. 

But it’s worth the investment because then they won’t be a burden to you. They will provide you with peace and joy which money can’t buy. 

If you want to parent your kids properly, you have to teach them about money. School doesn’t teach you about money.

**A big part of your financial success depends on you. Make a plan. Get yourself out of debt. Every single one of you is meant to prosper.**

**Remember, it requires no more effort to aim high in life, than it is to remain miserable in life. Change your mindset to align with prosperity.**
